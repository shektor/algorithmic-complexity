# Algorithmic Complexity

The aim is to understand efficiency as one of the dimensions of a good piece of code.


### Timing Framework

- Returns the time needed to execute a function on an array.
- The framework runs the function multiple times, with the array size increasing each time.
- The array increases in size from 5,000 to 1,000,000 in steps of 5,000.
- Each run outputs the time to the console.
